Hi, I'm Stephen Xie
I am a mechatronics engineering student looking to acquire practical experience in engineering and design.
I am interested in jobs and projects involving engineering and design, including (but not limited to) software development projects.
You can reach me at stephen.zh.xie@gmail.com

On my Github profile you will find my repositories from my studies at the University of Auckland as well as my personal projects.

I spent four years (2020-2023 at the University of Auckland studying for a Bachelor of Engineering (honours), majoring in Mechatronics.
In my first year, I learned the basic principles of coding in the C programming language.
In my second year, I extended my understanding of C to include object-oriented programming and version control, as well as using C to implement control systems in physical devices.
I also learned to use MATLAB and Simulink to study and model physical systems and process data efficiently.
In my third year, I practised using MATLAB and Simulink to develop control systems, model fluid dynamics and work with ordinary differential equations.

I am currently working on [what am I doing right now? Probably Screeps]
